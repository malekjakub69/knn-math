  abstract = {Machine recognition of a handwritten mathematical expression (HME) is challenging due to the ambiguities of handwritten symbols and the two-dimensional structure of mathematical expressions. Inspired by recent work in deep learning, we present Watch, Attend and Parse (WAP), a novel end-to-end approach based on neural network that learns to recognize HMEs in a two-dimensional layout and outputs them as one-dimensional character sequences in LaTeX format. Inherently unlike traditional methods, our proposed model avoids problems that stem from symbol segmentation, and it does not require a predefined expression grammar. Meanwhile, the problems of symbol recognition and structural analysis are handled, respectively, using a watcher and a parser. We employ a convolutional neural network encoder that takes HME images as input as the watcher and employ a recurrent neural network decoder equipped with an attention mechanism as the parser to generate LaTeX sequences. Moreover, the correspondence between the input expressions and the output LaTeX sequences is learned automatically by the attention mechanism. We validate the proposed approach on a benchmark published by the CROHME international competition. Using the official training dataset, WAP significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art method with an expression recognition accuracy of 46.55\% on CROHME 2014 and 44.55\% on CROHME 2016.}}

abstract="This paper overviews the 7th edition of the Competition on Recognition of Handwritten Mathematical Expressions. ICDAR 2023 CROHME proposes three tasks with three different modalities: on-line, off-line and bimodal. 3905 new handwritten equations have been collected to propose new training, validation and test sets for the two modalities. The complete training set includes previous CROHME training set extented with complementary off-line (from OffRaSHME competition) and on-line samples (generated). The evaluation is conducted using the same protocol as the previous CROHME, allowing a fair comparison with previous results. This competition allows for the first time the comparison of the on-line and off-line systems on the same test set. Six participating teams have been evaluated. Finally the same team won all 3 tasks with more than 80{\%} of expression recognition rate.",
